# All-In-One-Embedded-System-Proejct

## What is it?
It's an All-In-one Embedded System Project which detect and measure various stuff

## Features 
- detect and measure intensity of smoke
- calculate degree of temperature,
- detect the motion of objects in front of it 
- display all that on a LCD
- Turning on/off a led on it using a web page which is sent to any user connected to same network of ESP8266
- Working using batteries, so it doesn't need to connect to any external voltage source  (only in case it needs to be recharged)

## Tend-To-Add Features
- Anothor way to upload the page to the client
- Write the USART code from scratch without the software serial library of arduino 
- Display the measured values(temperature,smoke, existence of motion) on the web page too, not only on the LCD
- Make it looks better for normal user 


## A view on the system 
I like to structure things carefully to make each part clear and evident which ease the process of editing later 
so things like put the whole components on a PCB board, and to collect each collection of related wires together helped a lot to organize stuff
